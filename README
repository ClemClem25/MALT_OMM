This project is mainly for the installation of each MALT at the "Centre de Primatologie de Strasbourg"

You will find ressources to install the package OMM with some modified codes from the original version that you can find here :"https://github.com/open-cogsci/omm-client" 

Here is the list of the main modifications : 
    - OMM conditioner : JuicePumpCdp ; a new conditioner that allows you to send a "start character", a "stop character" and a "duration" in seconds that defines the time between each sending of character. You also have the check box "Juice".
Example of usage : Our pump with its interface card works this you need to send px (x being a number between 0 and 9 or m) that defines the power of the pump (m being maximal) and to turn it off "p0"

    - OMM detect participant : You can read two Serial ports at "a time" which in the case of the "Centre de Primatologie de Strasbourg" is very usefull as we have 2 RFID detectors. 
Furthermore the code has been modified to enable the detection on 15 Bytes with a sperator as a ";" between each RFID
