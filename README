# Installation Guide for MALT at the "Centre de Primatologie de Strasbourg"

This project is mainly for the installation of each MALT at the "Centre de Primatologie de Strasbourg".

You will find ressources to install the package OMM with some modified codes from the original version that you can find here: "https://github.com/open-cogsci/omm-client"

Here is the list of the main modifications:  
- OMM conditioner: JuicePumpCdp ; a new conditioner that allows you to send a "start character", a "stop character" and a "duration" in seconds that defines the time between each sending of character. You also have the check box "Juice". Example of usage: Our pump with its interface card works this you need to send px (x being a number between 0 and 9 or m) that defines the power of the pump (m being maximal) and to turn it off "p0"

- OMM detect participant: You can read two Serial ports at "a time" which in the case of the "Centre de Primatologie de Strasbourg" is very usefull as we have 2 RFID detectors. Furthermore the code has been modified to enable the detection on 15 Bytes with a sperator as a ";" between each RFID

## How to install or update on a new mini-PC:

1) Install OpenSesame: https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/4.0/download/#windows  
2) Install the OMM library: pip install https://github.com/open-cogsci/omm-client/archive/refs/tags/prerelease/0.7.0a3.zip here is the link where each release are downloaded: https://github.com/open-cogsci/omm-client/releases/tag/prerelease%2F0.7.0a3  
3) Modify each folder/file from this repository "OpenSesame\Lib\site-packages\opensesame_plugins\open_monkey_mind" by the new one on this GitHub (Install_folder_V1)  
4) Switch the port COM for the RFID readers and the pump to this: This part is necessary because each is test is coded with those port COM as reference  
   - Pump = Port COM24  
   - RFID Reader = Port COM23  
   - RFID Reader = Port COM22  
5) In OpenSesame go to "Tools > Preferences" and slide down until you find "Entry point (for connecting to the server)" clic on it after you have checked that just above the server is well parametred and connected. Then you need to do 2 things: 1st: change the wait image with image of banana that you can download in the folder "Set_of_Essentials" in this GitHub. 2nd: Change the Serial ports of the "detect"
